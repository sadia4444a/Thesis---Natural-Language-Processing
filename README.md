Thesis Abstract->>Many individuals in today’s digital age rely on the internet for nearly every purpose, including reading and viewing news on social networking sites. However, on occasion, these platforms distribute false information, which can have serious negative effects on both society and con- sumers. Because of the layout of online platforms, fake news is easily circulated. Fake news can be combated with tools, but most of them are only available to English speakers, which leaves millions of Bangla speakers out in the cold. The BanFakeNews dataset was first used in this study to create an efficient model for spotting fake news in Bangla. This dataset has 1,300 bogus and 48,000 legitimate news pieces. We used undersampling to remedy the imbalance. TF-IDF and BoW are two feature extraction techniques that are used to test several machine learning classifiers and Transformer model, including Bert. With an accuracy of 95.19%, our best-performing model was logistic regression with TF-IDF features. With 94.04% accuracy, Bangla-Bert-Base performs nearly identically. We attempted to obtain additional data by visit- ing Bangla fact-checking websites that flag bogus news and collect actual news headlines from YouTube, which offers a wealth of instantly accessible content because these articles were brief. Next, we used this scraped dataset which contains 1913 fake and 1995 Authentic news titles to evaluate several model detection capabilities for false information.
